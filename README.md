# Healthcare and Poverty
In this project the datat is based on 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year estimates. The data set inclded data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. 

Using this data I creates a scatter plot .

Using D3 techniques I created a scatter plot between Lack of Healthcare and Level of Poverty. Each state is represented by a  circle elements with the state abbreviations in the circles. Additionally I used tooltips to display the data on "mouse over".
